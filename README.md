## Features

- **Play against an AI:** Challenge yourself against a computer opponent with a simple minimax algorithm.
- **User  -friendly interface:** Intuitive controls and a visually appealing layout.
- **Responsive design:** The game adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining a consistent experience.
- **King pieces:** Experience the excitement of promoting your pieces to kings when they reach the opposite side of the board.
- **Move highlighting:** Valid moves are highlighted for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The programming language used for the game's logic and structure.
- **Pygame:** A popular library for creating games in Python, used for rendering graphics and handling user input.

## Installation

To get started with the Checkers Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/checkers.git
   cd checkers
   ```

2. **Install Pygame:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Then, install the Pygame library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Run the game:**
   Execute the following command to start the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Select a piece:** Click on one of your pieces to select it.
2. **Make a move:** Click on a valid square to move your selected piece. The valid moves will be highlighted in blue.
3. **Capture opponent pieces:** If you land on a square occupied by an opponent's piece, you will capture it.
4. **Promote to king:** When a piece reaches the opposite end of the board, it will be promoted to a king, gaining additional movement capabilities.
5. **Win the game:** The game ends when one player has no pieces left or cannot make a legal move.

## Gameplay Mechanics

- The game is played on an 8x8 board with two players: Light and Dark.
- Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally on the dark squares.
- A player can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it, landing on the empty square directly beyond it.
- Kings can move both forward and backward, providing strategic advantages.

## AI Opponent

The AI opponent uses a minimax algorithm to evaluate potential moves and select the best one. It simulates various game states to make informed decisions, providing a challenging experience for players.
